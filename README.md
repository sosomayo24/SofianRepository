This repository contains my beginner-level Java notes and my first automation script using Selenium WebDriver. The Java notes, written in Eclipse, cover topics like the history of Java, why Java is considered secure (including features like the JVM and bytecode verification), and other core concepts explained with simple code comments. The automation script demonstrates how to launch a Chrome browser and automatically open websites like Instagram, Facebook, and Google using Selenium WebDriver. This project helped me understand how WebDriver interacts with browsers and serves as the foundation for my future automation testing work.
