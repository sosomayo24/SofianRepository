	//1. JVM (Java Virtual Machine) - The brain of java - verifies the byte code before it is ran - ensures proper location for the path
	
	//2. Security Manager - this is a layer present in JVM. 
		// It makes sure hackers or untrusted code does not manage to access some APIs and features of the platform
	
	//3. No use of pointers - can lead to memory access
	
	//4. Access modifiers(4) - Public, Private, Protected, Default - all in the hands of the developer
		//controls the accessibility and visibility of the code
	
	//5. Exception Handling
	
	//6. Own Memory Management
